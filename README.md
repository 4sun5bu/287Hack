# 80287XL Hacking

Intel 80287XL is a FPU for 16-bit CPU 80286. It works as the I/O device for 286, and it can run with other CPUs.    
I have connected 287XL to Arduino Mega, and investigated how to operate it.  
This repository contains a circuit connection diagram and a test code drawing Mandelbrot ASCIIART.
